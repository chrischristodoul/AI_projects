AI PROJECT 2023-24
I develop Java projects focused on Artificial Intelligence algorithms and game implementations.

CSEESC Game with Minimax AI: A turn-based board game where players use strategic letter placement. The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal decisions, challenging the human player in a dynamic environment.

8-Puzzle Solver with Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A* Search: Java implementations of UCS and A* algorithms to solve the classic 8-puzzle sliding tiles problem. The solvers efficiently explore possible states to find the minimum-cost solution path, demonstrating search algorithm fundamentals and heuristic optimization.

These projects showcase my skills in AI algorithm implementation, game logic design, and problem-solving using Java.

How to run:

Compile the Java file(s):
  bash
  javac EightPuzzleSolverUcs.java
  javac EightPuzzleSolverAstar.java
  javac CSEESCGAME.java
  
RUN the java files:

  ```bash
  java EightPuzzleSolver
  java CSEESCGAME.java










Feel free to explore the code and modify parameters to experiment with AI algorithms and game strategies.
